# 6. Clases y Objetos
So far, our programs have only used built-in Python datatypes.  In
this section, we introduce the concept of classes and objects.  You'll
learn about the `class` statement that allows you to make new objects.
We'll also introduce the concept of inheritance, a tool that is commonly
use to build extensible programs.  Finally, we'll look at a few other
features of classes including special methods, dynamic attribute lookup,
and defining new exceptions.
